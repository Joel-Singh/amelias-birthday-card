        Amelia!! Thank you for being the most wonderful lovely roommate I
        couldâ€™ve ever asked for. Going into our first year last year was
        terrifying, but having such a kind person to share a room with made it
        1000% better. Happy birthday, I canâ€™t wait to be back in 303 soon!!!

        Happy happy birthday Amelia!!!!! Youâ€™re 20, ahhhh. I genuinely donâ€™t
        know what Iâ€™d do without you. I hope you have the best freaking birthday
        ever and I canâ€™t wait to share a plate of friendship fries when we get
        back to campus (only 22 days left!!!!!!)

        many areas. Happy birthday!!!
